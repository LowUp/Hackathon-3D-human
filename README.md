# 3D Model Viewer with Interactive Makeup Application

This project allows users to view a 3D model and interactively apply makeup to different parts of the model by clicking on them.  It uses Three.js for rendering and provides controls for rotating, zooming, and resetting the view.  Additional features include a wireframe toggle and an information box that displays details about the clicked part.

## Features

* **3D Model Loading and Display:** Loads a 3D model (GLB format) and displays it in an interactive 3D viewer.
* **Interactive Makeup Application:** Click on different parts of the model to apply a temporary makeup effect (color change).
* **Orbit Controls:** Rotate, pan, and zoom the camera to view the model from different angles.
* **Reset View:** Resets the camera to its default position.
* **Wireframe Toggle:**  Switch between solid and wireframe rendering modes.
* **Information Display:** Displays a pop-up box with information about the clicked part of the model (currently placeholder text).
